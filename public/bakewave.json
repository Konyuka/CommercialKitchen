Therefore what are the current commercial baking oven prices in Kenya?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obvious and must-have is a commercial baking oven, among the list of equipment you will come up with. The next step is probably to go online.Without a doubt you would search for the shop selling&nbsp; the least possible price for the oven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But do you consider the quality or the manufacturing specifications like the amount of insulation, warranty, energy efficiency&nbsp; etc.?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-purpose-of-this-blog\">Purpose of this blog<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you\u2019re planning to start a bakery business in Kenya this blog will help you understand the different types of ovens. Additionally, it explains their preferred energy sources respectively.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you have an existing bakery this blog will assist you in upgrading to better energy-efficient bakery ovens.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This blog is reviewing different quality commercial bakery ovens. Additionally will advise you on latest innovations and efficiency in bakery ovens available in Kenya. Most importantly also is their different production capacities and prices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bakewave-sales-desk\">Bakewave Sales Desk<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting at the sales deck of Bakewave Limited I\u2019m amazed at how most buyers will only talk about price .This happens almost during the entire conversation unless i bring up the topic of quality and energy efficiency .<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth be told is that manufacturers of the equipment all over the world have different standards of manufacturing based on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>i. Regulation by their own countries.<\/strong><br><strong>ii. The target client (country)and their regulations.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-porlanmaz-bakery-machinery-turkey\">Porlanmaz Bakery Machinery-Turkey<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bakewave limited having worked for the last 10 years with one of the top of bakery&nbsp; equipment exporters around the world. We had an opportunity to visit the Porlanmaz factory several times and would say the standards are top-notch. For this reason they sell all over the world including USA, India, Europe (at least 100 countries).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To cut the long story short below is a preview of the standards followed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.porlanmaz.com\/\">Porlanmaz<\/a>;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"846\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Porlanmaz-TUV-Standard-1024x846.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2378\" title=\"Porlanmaz TUV Standard\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Porlanmaz-TUV-Standard-1024x846.png 1024w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Porlanmaz-TUV-Standard-768x635.png 768w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Porlanmaz-TUV-Standard-600x496.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Porlanmaz Manufacturing Standards<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"556\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Porlanmaz-Engineering-1024x556.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2376\" title=\"Porlanmaz Engineering\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Porlanmaz-Engineering-1024x556.png 1024w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Porlanmaz-Engineering-768x417.png 768w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Porlanmaz-Engineering-600x326.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Porlanmaz Engineering Section<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Simon-at-porlanmaz-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2379\" title=\"Simon at porlanmaz\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Simon-at-porlanmaz-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Simon-at-porlanmaz-600x800.jpeg 600w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Simon-at-porlanmaz.jpeg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">In photo; Mr. Barongo (Managing Director) to the right, Mr. Muammer Demirci (Director, Porlanmaz Group),and to the far left Simon (Sales Director)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Porlanmaz factory for instance has invested in the latest robotic laser cut technology from Japan. Their technical team has engineers from Germany. Additionally they&nbsp; have outsourced a stand-alone , pure precision factory .This facility sits on almost 2 acre of precision equipment producing small parts including the smallest of nuts and bolts. Talk of very advanced machines for making other machines!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bakewave-machinery-brand-subcontracted-from-very-high-quality-chinese-manufacturer\">Bakewave machinery Brand-subcontracted from Very High quality Chinese manufacturer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why did I bring this story up?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is because Bakewave moved to high quality but&nbsp; affordable oven segment last year after covid-19 pandemic. Among the&nbsp; reasons for this is Turkey underwent&nbsp; over 85% inflation in 2020 until now and it has been so every year. This made prices of imports(baking equipment included) go up and became out of reach for most African countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had to vet over&nbsp; 30 baking equipment manufacturers factories from Guangzhou China,Hongkong and Shanghai. Having dealt with high quality&nbsp; baking equipment all through ,we were determined to&nbsp; match or even surpass Porlanmaz quality. AND YES WE GOT IT RIGHT!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consequently we can now&nbsp; continue offering high quality, low consumption, and low maintenance baking equipment of all sizes. We are still also working with Porlanmaz but customers must order by paying a downpayment. For Porlanmaz equipment we can also do exfactory prices for large bakery projects .These two strategies have allowed us to be able to offer the best prices for quality commercial baking ovens in Kenya<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"750\" height=\"638\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Astar-Certificeates.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2374\" title=\"CE Certification\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Astar-Certificeates.jpg 750w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Astar-Certificeates-600x510.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Some of the certifications earned by our manufacturer in Guangzhou, due to attaining high manufacturing standards.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"849\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Canton-1024x849.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2375\" title=\"Canton Kitchen Equipment Export Agent\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Canton-1024x849.png 1024w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Canton-768x637.png 768w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Canton-600x497.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Our manufacturer in China has been ranked the top export agent.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we are focusing on the 2 deck 4 tray oven.

It is fairly easy to operate.<br>xii. Each section of the deck oven is equipped with bulb inside and glass window on the door for viewing what is baking inside.<br>xiii. Each deck is equipped with a timer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Wow!&nbsp;These are so many features that Bakewave has put together for you bakers but let me discuss just a few important ones that touch directly on power consumption.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-heavy-insulated-deck-oven-weighing-120kg\"><strong>Heavy insulated deck oven(weighing 120kg)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Why a two deck oven is this heavy? It is because of the amount of stone wool used for insulation that works to trap heat lost to the surroundings and hence preventing more heat consumption. This ensures also the working environment is conducive and prevents overheating which has adverse effects on a baker\u2019s health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-deck-oven-with-front-heat-resistive-glass-timer-and-bulb\"><strong>Deck oven with front heat resistive glass,timer and bulb<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These features allow you to check the progress of the baking products without opening the door. Do you know that you can lose up to 20-50% heat depending on how long and often your door is open during baking? This means that your power consumption increases by 20 \u2013 50%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ergonomic-handle-for-commercial-deck-baking-oven-prices-in-kenya\"><strong>Ergonomic handle for Commercial Deck baking oven prices in Kenya<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What most bakers do not know is that an insulated handle:<br>i. Loses less heat to the surrounding and therefore to the environment<br>ii. Cannot burn your hands (avoids serious injuries)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly bakers, all these features in an oven! Certainly, this cannot be the cheapest oven in the market .However in one year you will save between KSH 50,000 \u2013 100,000 using such energy efficient single deck oven as opposed to light one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a place like China, for the single deck oven there are probably more than 10 classes of quality. This&nbsp; is why we as Bakewave are getting you the best. So please bakers before you rush to make decisions based on price please check the standards .In particular energy saving features of the oven before making a decision because what is cheap now could end up costing you more in your baking journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/news\/deck-oven\/\">CLICK HERE<\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;to know the latest price of our deck oven series.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=WFHX2Fo6K6A%3Ffeature%3Doembed\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-commercial-convection-baking-oven-prices-in-kenya\">COMMERCIAL CONVECTION BAKING OVEN PRICES IN KENYA<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to high costs of all energy sources(gas, fuel, electric ovens) used by commercial bakers in Kenya, Bakewave has introduced customized commercial convection ovens<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 3 types of commercial baking ovens in Kenya<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-commercial-deck-baking-oven-prices-in-kenya\">1. Commercial Deck baking oven prices in Kenya<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The deck ovens have 2 options of powering them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Option 1; 100% electric powered<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option 2; Hybrid model -95% gas(energy used for baking) and about 5% electric for the temperature control panel and timer operations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For deck ovens in Kenya is the preferred option is electric powered especially if you get a well insulated type like the Bakewave model described above<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gas option has recently been abandoned due to increased gas prices<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-commercial-convection-baking-ovens-prices-in-kenya\">2. Commercial Convection Baking Ovens Prices in Kenya<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The convection ovens are usually powered by 2 options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Option 1-100% electric powered<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Option 2- Hybrid model -95% gas(energy used for baking) and about 5% electric for the temperature control panel and timer operations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Again in Kenya today electric option for convection ovens is the preferred option since its cheaper on power consumption since gas prices went up<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These convection ovens are electric and customized with tray sizes of 50cm by 70cm for the 5 tray, 6tray, 10tray and 12 tray options available. They produce 60, 80, 140 and 192 loaves per hour respectively with the cost per loaf kes 0.65 per loaf(0n power cost) making them the least consuming of all the three types of commercial ovens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deck ovens are ideal&nbsp; for startup bakeries since the investment for the entire equipment is not much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For mid-level baking of about 1000-2000 loaves or packets per day, the ideal oven is a convection oven. This is because it consumes less and gives very high-quality products.&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/commercial-convection-oven-for-baking-in-kenya\/\">CL<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/news\/commercial-convection-oven-for-baking\/\">ICK HERE TO SEE SPECS AND CURRENT PRICES<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if your production capacity is above 2000 loaves what option is best for you?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can either decide to buy 2 convection ovens or more. The other option is to consider the diesel powered rotary ovens<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=3HSHfM5hyUY%3Fstart%3D326%26feature%3Doembed\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=JuMwQvc2Cc0%3Ffeature%3Doembed\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-commercial-rotary-baking-oven-prices-in-kenya\">COMMERCIAL ROTARY BAKING OVEN PRICES IN KENYA<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>They are mainly diesel powered and ideal for production capacity of above 2,000loaves or packets per day per shift.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An 100% electric option is available but does not have good efficiency since Kw for such electric ovens is very high (68-85) Kw depending on oven capacity. They can consume a lot of electric power<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are targeting about 3000-5000 loaves per day production the diesel powered rotary oven would be the ideal machine.Cost per loaf(on diesel power) is about kes 1 to 1.50 depending on oven capacity and efficiency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have three capacities as illustrated below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"614\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Rotary-Ovens-16-32-and-64-Tray-1024x614.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2380\" title=\"Commercial Rotary Ovens in Kenya\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Rotary-Ovens-16-32-and-64-Tray-1024x614.webp 1024w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Rotary-Ovens-16-32-and-64-Tray-768x461.webp 768w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Rotary-Ovens-16-32-and-64-Tray-600x360.webp 600w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/Rotary-Ovens-16-32-and-64-Tray.webp 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Bakewave Rotary Ovens<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To improve fuel efficiency for the rotary ovens,we are using the Danfoss diesel burner from Denmark (see image below)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Rotary-oven-burner-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2381\" title=\"Rotary oven burner\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Rotary-oven-burner-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Rotary-oven-burner-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Rotary-oven-burner-580x435.jpg 580w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Rotary-oven-burner-600x450.jpg 600w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/09\/Rotary-oven-burner.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Bakewave Rotary Oven Burner<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>See the entire video of our 32 tray rotary oven below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=1rohNuwnnMc%3Ffeature%3Doembed\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DRVjCgZ1Pds%3Ffeature%3Doembed\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/the-big-bakery-bonanza\/starter-solutions.php?source=website\"><strong>CLICK <\/strong><\/a><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/the-big-bakery-bonanza\/starter-solutions.php?source=website\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow\">HERE<\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;to view each oven together with a complete set of bakery accessories that will help you start your own bakery business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope this article helps you understand the different commercial baking oven prices in Kenya.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking to start a bakery, feel free to ask any questions below.

This is especially if your bakery is located in areas with very high temperatures like Mombasa or Kisumu<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-provides-large-storage-as-you-sell\"><strong>2.Provides large storage as you sell.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bakewave horizontal display counter comes in various length with 1.2m,1.5m and 1.8m are the most popular each is 650m wide. Each has 3 tiers. Also the top is flat allowing you to display even more products that do not require refrigeration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of this large space is to allow you to store excess of your baked products but at the same time on the eyes of the buyer allowing you to sell from the store.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"724\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Bakewave-Cake-Display-1024x724.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2220\" title=\"Cake display 1.5 meters\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Bakewave-Cake-Display-1024x724.webp 1024w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Bakewave-Cake-Display-768x543.webp 768w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/08\/Bakewave-Cake-Display-600x424.webp 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Bakewave Cake Display<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-well-lit-attractive-products\"><strong>3.Well-lit attractive products<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The front side and top are made of thick glass. This allows the customer to visualize your products irrespective of their position in your shop. Furthermore, the display counter is well lit with LED lights allowing your products to be visible in all its glamour and color.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can affect the emotions of your customer which pushes them to decide to purchase instantly. In fact based on our previous upgrades to clients who did not have modern display chillers in their cake shops, they got more than 50% more business by just installing the modern cake display.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-nbsp-energy-efficient\"><strong>4.&nbsp;Energy efficient.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because it\u2019s equipped with LED wires for lighting that consume less power and lasts for very many years. In fact, its total power rating is 0.65kw which includes the condenser + compressor + 2 fans of cooling + 1 fan for cooling the condenser.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-very-high-quality-latest-technology-and-affordable\"><strong>5.

But you wake up one morning Alas! You find your cake display temperature reading 18\u00b0c and that nice chocolate topping and cream all melted!!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How scary can this be? But you need to consider the following 5 possible reasons why this is happening:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-gas-depletion\"><strong>1.

Just to clarify further of all the three ovens used for commercial baking in Kenya some can be powered by&nbsp;electricity (100%), others by&nbsp;gas (95%) and electricity ( 5%)&nbsp;and finally for the rotary oven diesel&nbsp;(95%) and electricity ( 8%). They are hybrid models but in these models electricity consumption is negligible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gas deck ovens were not common by then, so one had to choose between an&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/news\/deck-oven\/\">electric deck oven<\/a>&nbsp;(100%) or a diesel rotary oven (hybrid). With deck ovens not improved and well insulated, the power consumption was very high, the only advantage was they were affordable. However, any bakery that could afford a rotary oven which by then was averaging (1.5M- 2.9M) Ksh depending on production capacity, was enjoying the best possible energy-efficient baking since the cost of diesel per liter by then was low. (Rotary ovens use between 2.5L \u2013 4L of diesel per hour depending on capacity of the oven). Their cost of loaf in terms of energy spent was definitely below 0.80ksh (80 cents).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this time trying to introduce an electric convection oven would definitely be going against the grain. Gas was even more difficult because even today there is a general fear on the use of gas ovens in commercial baking. A part could be because large volumes of gas are needed weekly and handling it could be a challenge. To cut the long story short, in 7 years Bake wave has installed more than 150 commercial electric convection ovens across supermarkets, schools, cake shops, hospitals, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HOW DID THIS NARATIVE CHANGE?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all began with the first buyer in September 2015. After trying to convince them for almost 1 month that a 14-tray electric convection oven would give you the same quality &amp; baking efficiency as a rotary oven (though half in price &amp; capacity as opposed to a rotary oven). Juja Ecomart Supermarket Kawangware finally decided to give Bakewave a chance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The magic happened! The oven efficiency was much higher than expected. Producing 140 loaves per hour and electricity consumption of 5 units per hour (125ksh). This was definitely less than 1 ksh just like the rotary oven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bakewave installed the entire bakery which included dough mixers, proofer, bread slicer and all baking accessories. We also provided free training on baked products and also recipes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project was so successful that 6 months later, Juja Ecomart set up a second bakery in their branch in Uthiru with the convection oven. In 2018 they opened a mega large bakery in their newest branch in Juja town.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The supermarket referred more than 10 clients in a span of 4 years and all have set up. They allowed them to visit their bakeries and learn on the new acquired project with such a high efficiency. It\u2019s important to note that a convection oven is such a modern oven equipped with the latest steaming technology and produces very high products: golden brown color for bread and soft crust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/14-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Golden Brown Bread\" title=\"Golden Brown Bread\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Golden Brown Bread made from one of Bakewave&#8217;s Clients<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/40-other-details-images-17-e1657028164366.jpg?fit=1281%2C1060&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" title=\"Special Turkish Bread (Photo Credit: Porlanmaz)\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Special Turkish Bread (Photo Credit: Porlanmaz)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Convection-Oven-1000x1000-1.png?fit=1000%2C1000&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Convection-Oven\" title=\"14 Tray Convection Oven\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Porlanmaz 14 Tray Convection Oven<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another notable client is Joflow bakers in Kawangware. After learning the success story from Juja Ecomart Kawangware he bought his first&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.porlanmaz.com\/u_convection-oven-electrical-convection-oven-pastry-oven-oven-for-patisseries-oven-for-pastry-confectionery-oven_17_en.html\">14 tray convection oven<\/a>. To our surprise he came back later in 6 months and bought a second unit at that time each unit was going for 1.2M ksh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He again came back 3<sup>rd<\/sup>&nbsp;time to buy another convection oven but we sat down and advised him to consider a rotary oven since he was producing very&nbsp; large&nbsp;&nbsp; quantities of buns and scones for distribution. We managed to convince him to rotary oven but this time on the basis of quantity of products to be baked. Energy consumption for both convection oven and rotary was same per packet of buns at that time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary these two success stories definitely say something about the commercial convection ovens used verses deck ovens or rotary ovens. Let\u2019s look into the advantages why Bake wave beat the narrative that any commercial 100% electric oven consumes a lot of power. It is because of the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-top-7-reasons-why-convection-oven-is-better\">TOP 7 REASONS WHY CONVECTION OVEN IS BETTER<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-the-commercial-convection-is-ideal-for-mid-level-baking-e-g-1000-2000-loaves-or-packets-per-day\">1. The commercial convection is ideal for mid-level baking e.g. 1000 \u2013 2000 loaves or packets per day.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be a mini\u2013supermarket, a hot bread or cake shop business, a mini\u2013bread or cake factory, a hospital or a school.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because such bakeries described above, produce a variety of products and a convection oven is fast enough and ideal to produce such products.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/EarlyBird-Convection-Oven-14-Tray.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" title=\"EarlyBird Convection Oven 14 Tray\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Convection Oven at Earlybird Kindergarten<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Convection-Oven-Matata-Hospital-Oyugis.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" title=\"Convection Oven Matata Hospital Oyugis\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The 14 tray bakery installation at Matata hospital in Homabay County, Oyugis town<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/IMG_0121-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" title=\"IMG_0121\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">14 Tray installation and training at Parkmart Supermarket<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>NB: If your production is lower than this you can consider our 5 tray, 10 tray convection ovens that are available. This will adjust your efficiency to almost that of 14 tray convection oven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-commercial-convection-ovens-consume-less-power\"><strong>2. Commercial Convection Ovens Consume less power.<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Example 14 tray convection oven will produce 140 loaves per hour it will spend 5 units of power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1 unit of power is 25.00 ksh<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5 units of power is 125.00ksh<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore: 1 loaf on power alone will cost (125 Ksh \u00d7 1 loaf)&nbsp;<strong>\/&nbsp;<\/strong>140 loaves = 0.89ksh<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will cost 0.89 ksh to produce a loaf in 14 tray convection oven at 70 loaves per batch of 25minutes baking time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NB: with the increasing diesel prices in Kenya today. This could be the best efficiency so far. However, a convection oven has a limit on capacity and can only produce a maximum of 1400 loaves per 10 hours of baking. Therefore very large bakeries producing more than 6000 loaves, the rotary oven remains their option for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-the-convection-ovens-occupy-less-space\"><strong>3. The convection ovens occupy less space<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Bakewave\u2019s journey to equip especially mini \u2013 supermarkets with bakeries has been challenged by space availability in such outlets. That\u2019s why convection oven was a perfect fit since it occupies less space as compared to both deck and convection ovens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>e.g&nbsp; A 12 tray convection oven with trolley is only 1.2m wide by 1.4m deep and 2m high as compared to a 9 tray deck oven which is 1.6m wide by&nbsp; 0.8m deep and 1.5m high<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Convection-Oven-vs-Deck-oven-size.png?fit=3840%2C2160&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"commercial convection oven vs commercial 3 deck 9 tray oven\" title=\"Convection Oven vs Deck oven size\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Convection Oven VS Deck Oven 3 deck 9 Tray Size Comparison<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-the-convection-oven-has-the-best-baking-uniformity-nbsp\"><strong>4. The convection oven has the best baking uniformity&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is in comparison to its predecessors: deck ovens and rotary ovens. To understand this more clearly we need to examine how it works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-a-does-a-convection-oven-work\">How a does a convection oven work:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the distinctive working principle is at the availability of the powerful fans inside the baking chamber. The work of these fans is to forcefully circulate hot air (heat) that is emitted from the small heating coils normally 1, 2 or 3 depending on convection oven size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This way of circulating heat is very efficient and this heat reaches all parts of the oven equally hence very high baking uniformity and lesser baking time is achieved. This leads to lower power consumption or fuel (in case of gas)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not easy to achieve the same results in a rotary oven. You will require to do several heat adjustment on the heat levels to achieve this. For the deck oven you will require to master the upper temperature and the lower temperature in a deck and the timing. In overall convection oven is easy to use and control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-the-convection-ovens-require-low-maintenance\"><strong>5. The convection ovens require low maintenance<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the three commercial types of oven that is convection, deck and rotary oven, convection oven has the least maintenance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years the &nbsp;years the only major maintenance our Bake wave technical team has carried out is cleaning the mesh covering the baking chamber to keep the small holes open to allow the fan to work properly without obstructing air flow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Porlanmaz-14-tray-convection-oven-mesh.png?fit=2880%2C2160&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"commercial convection oven with mesh inside\" title=\"Porlanmaz 14 tray convection oven mesh\"\/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Porlanmaz 14 tray convection oven mesh (Credit: Porlanmaz)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This can be done by bakers themselves by making sure every day after baking they take a moist cloth and wipe the mesh interior and of the convection oven.

When this steam at high temperatures touches your dough it causes an oven spring giving you that well-rounded, tight, turgid well-risen bread shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second impact and the most important is that the crust (the outer visible layer of your baked product) attains a golden brown color and becomes soft<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know customers will rush to pick the soft golden brown bread products: steam does magic to your bread or bread-related products such as buns, rolls, scones, special bread etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commercial convection ovens due to large powerful fans in the baking chamber heat circulation is highly improved and this reduces baking time. This avoids over baking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-7-produces-high-quality-products\"><strong>7.

This is after talking to several customers who are running small and midsized bakeries around Kenya. Are you looking for Bakery Mixer Machine Price in Kenya?Please read this first!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WHY ARE SOME BAKERY BUSINESSES SHUTTING DOWN IN KENYA:CHEAP BAKING EQUIPMENT?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bakewave has discovered that there are two types of cheap dough mixers being sold in the market today. But these two could be the beginning of high costs for bakers and the reason why some bakeries are unable to grow faster than they are supposed to. These two types are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.SINGLE PHASE MOTOR + 6 GEAR BOX SYSTEM<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This type is prone to gears getting worn out after a short period especially when machine is overloaded with more flour than usual. Also the gears wear out naturally even with normal flour capacity .&nbsp;<strong>We have discovered that the cost of replacing one gear is kes 15,000.00.Therefore to repair the machine could cost up to kes 90,000.00 every year. Some bakers have repaired their machine twice&nbsp; year meaning they spent kes 180,000 for a machine they initially bought about kes 185,000..!These are indeed shocking details.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.3 PHASE MOTOR + a gadget known as \u201cDRIVE\u201d that converts single phase power to 3 phase allowing you to use the mixer with single phase power.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this comes at a very hefty price. The drive is prone to getting burnt ANYTIME because of:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a)Power fluctuation especially less voltage .This can happen anytime and any day without warning<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b)Loading excess flour than recommended or very hard dough(using less water than recommended )<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>c)even if the mixer is loaded according to recommended flour capacity the DRIVE device just wears out naturally with time(after 6 months of use) and could fail anytime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cost of replacing the drive is kes 70,000.00 for 30 kg spiral dough mixer and kes 85,000 for 40kg spiral dough mixer.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why are machine stockists in Kenya doing this? This is to avoid stocking both single phase and 3 phase version of the same machine because it means stocking two times the number of mixers. This is very expensive considering they could sell hundreds of these machines per year. This is because some clients don\u2019t have access to three phase power.BUT AS YOU CAN SEE ABOVE THIS COMES AS A HEFTY COST TO YOU THE BUYER!!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BAKEWAVES SOLUTION TO DOUGH MIXER CRISIS(ABOVE) IN KENYA<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>1.PULLEY SYSTEM+BELT+CAPACITORS+SINGLE PHASE MOTOR(see video at end of this blog)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is for customers with single phase power<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the last 2 years we have tested this new technology and we have very good outcome. It has reduced dough mixers cost of maintenance by over 95%!!!WHY IS THIS SO?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They only need to change the belt after at least 1 year. COST OF BELT THAT BAKEWAVE STOCKS IS KES 3,000 ONLY. Up to now some mixers have gone up to 2 years without a requiring a change of belt or any repair cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.PULLEY SYSTEM+BELT+CAPACITORS+3 PHASE&nbsp; MOTOR(see video at the end of this blog)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 3 phase customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again the only item that is worn out is the belt which will costs only kes 3,500.00 to buy from Bakewave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DISADVANTAGE<\/strong>: Bakewave has to stock each model both in single phase and 3 phase options. As a result&nbsp; there are almost 8 models this means 16 stock items only as dough mixers. This means sometimes we experience stock out but we are doing our best build this stock though its very costly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This has changed small to mid sized bakers fortunes and has removed the heavy maintenance burden. This combined with the new technology&nbsp; Bakewave&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/news\/single-deck-oven-price-in-kenya\/\">deck oven series<\/a>&nbsp;that is highly insulated(consumes 20% less than cheaper less insulated deck ovens).Ensures Bakers can now cut their costs of power by 20% and cost of maintenance by over 90%.This has seen then start to grow and come back to Bakewave for bigger and even more efficient ovens like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/news\/commercial-baking-ovens-in-kenya-quality-price-explained\/\" class=\"broken_link\">CONVECTION OVENS<\/a>&nbsp;instead of them remaining redundant or closing down.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait a minute: Could these be major reasons why some bakeries end up closing down?Has Bakewave finally managed to change the course of many startup and small bakeries in Kenya. . Do you have a bakery and has experienced high costs of maintenance? How has this affected your business? Give us your views below. Are you considering Bakery Mixer Machine Price in Kenya? What factors do you consider before making the decision to buy the mixer?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This powerful, industrial-grade mixer is designed to help you meet the high demands of your bakery by making the dough mixing process more efficient and effective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a massive 60kg capacity, this dough mixer can handle even the largest batches of dough, allowing you to produce more baked goods in less time. Its robust design and powerful motor ensure that it can handle even the toughest doughs, making it an ideal choice for busy bakeries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key features of the Dough Mixer Machine 30kg is its easy-to-use control panel. With just a few simple buttons, you can adjust the speed and direction of the mixer, allowing you to achieve the perfect consistency for your dough every time. Plus, its built-in timer ensures that you can keep track of your mixing times accurately and consistently, reducing the risk of over or under-mixing your dough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another standout feature of this dough mixer is its durable construction. Made from high-quality stainless steel, it is built to withstand the rigors of daily use in a busy bakery environment. Its sleek, modern design also makes it easy to clean and maintain, ensuring that it looks great and performs well for years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However from my interactions with new clients who want to venture into a bakery business I have concluded that most do not differentiate between a dough mixer (bread mixer) and a planetary mixer (cake mixer).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s just make this topic for another day since today we are focused on dough mixers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is dough mixer?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Planetary mixer vs dough mixer<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I cannot continue without emphasizing the fact that the dough mixer is a heavy-duty machine with a more powerful motor and its mixing arm is spiral.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These factors make it ideal for mixing the tough bread dough (it\u2019s also for mandazi, chapatti, buns, rolls, cones, etc.) as opposed to the light water-like cake dough that requires a cake mixer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cake mixer has a small motor hence less power and also mixing arms include&nbsp;<em>whisk type<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>beta-type<\/em>&nbsp;to drive more air into your dough (froth). This combines with eggs and baking powder to produce the oven spring to give you that well-risen cake.Intrested in cake or planetary mixers and not dough or spiral mixers.&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bakewave.co.ke\/product\/cake-mixer\/\">CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON CAKE MIXERS<\/a>.IF INTRESTED IN BREAD OR SPIRAL DOUGH MIXER CONTINUE READING THIS BLOG.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3105-scaled-1-1024x683.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1552\" style=\"width:840px;height:560px\" width=\"840\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3105-scaled-1-1024x683.webp 1024w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3105-scaled-1-768x512.webp 768w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3105-scaled-1-600x400.webp 600w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3105-scaled-1.webp 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3108-scaled-1-1024x683.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1553\" style=\"width:840px;height:560px\" width=\"840\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3108-scaled-1-1024x683.webp 1024w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3108-scaled-1-768x512.webp 768w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3108-scaled-1-600x400.webp 600w, https:\/\/bakewave.co.ke\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/06\/IMG_3108-scaled-1.webp 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Size Dough Mixer Do I need?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Going back on today\u2019s topic, as a first-time buyer for a dough mixer there are 5 terminologies you need to familiarize yourself with:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Bowl capacity<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Flour capacity<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dough capacity<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Power (KW)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No of motors<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Dough mixer Bowl capacity<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s the total amount of water that can fill the mixing bowl of your dough mixer at a time(without adding any other baking ingredient like flour or margarine)process but it just provides a measures of how big your bowl is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Dough mixer Flour capacity<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, flour capacity for your dough mixer carries the day as the most important consideration you need to consider. This is why if you confuse your flour capacity with dough capacity you will end up buying a small mixer that will not be able to mix enough flour to fill at least one batch or two of your oven. As a baker you know one of the ways you save on power is by baking full batches according to your maximum oven capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A full batch at maximum oven capacity baked at the right time and followed immediately by the next batch without switching off the oven will ensure you achieve maximum efficiency on time, labor and power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dough Mixer flour capacity is such an important factor to consider when navigating Bakery Mixer Machine Price in Kenya<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will remain to be a pipe dream if your dough mixer capacity is less one batch. See below an example of a bake wave dough mixer models and their respective flour capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Table 1: Dough Mixer Capacity Chart<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>MODEL<\/td><td>BOWL CAPACITY<\/td><td>FLOUR<br>CAPACITY<\/td><td>DOUGH<br>CAPACITY<\/td><td>KW<\/td><td>NUMBER OF MOTORS<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BDM 30<\/td><td>35<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>30<\/td><td>1.5<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BDM 40<\/td><td>45<\/td><td>16<\/td><td>40<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BDM 60<\/td><td>65<\/td><td>25<\/td><td>60<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BDM 80<\/td><td>85<\/td><td>33<\/td><td>80<\/td><td>8.6<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BDM 130<\/td><td>135<\/td><td>50<\/td><td>130<\/td><td>12.7<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly you need to know the oven capacity of your product e.g bread so that you can determine the flour that is needed to bake one full batch of that product and then determine your flour capacity which will lead you to dough capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most machine sellers will use dough capacity as their model name. This will always be a number. For example<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>BWDM30 Model=Bake Wave Dough Mixer 30 (total capacity)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dough capacity should be a key thing to consider when checking Bakery Mixer Machine Price in Kenya.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Case study:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What minimum capacity of dough mixer will a bakery in Kenya require if they are using a 3 deck oven 6 tray?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>A 3 deck oven produces 45 loaves per batch of 30 minutes of 400grams.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Each 1kg of flour produces 3 loaves of 400grams tinned bread.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>From (1) and (2) above we can know how much flour we need in a 3 deck oven:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>45 loaves x 1kg flour&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp; &nbsp;15kgs flour<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><del>Dough mixer in Kenya<\/del><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3 loaves<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From our chart above looking at flour capacity the ideal mixer model is BWDM40 or simply 40kg dough capacity!!!&nbsp;<strong>Very impressive!!!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.Calculating your&nbsp; Dough&nbsp; mixer capacity<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply the total dough weight achieved after the mixing process is complete.

They provide consistent heat distribution, allowing for even baking, and come in a variety of sizes to accommodate different kitchen needs. In this blog post, we\u2019ll explore the benefits of gas deck ovens, their features, and how to choose the right one for your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-benefits-of-a-gas-deck-oven\">Benefits of a Gas Deck Oven:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>It provides consistent heat distribution:&nbsp;Gas deck ovens are designed to provide consistent heat distribution throughout the cooking chamber. This ensures that your baked goods are baked evenly and thoroughly, preventing undercooked or burnt areas.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>It is fitted with high-temperature capability:&nbsp;Gas deck ovens can reach high temperatures, making them ideal for baking a wide range of products, including bread, pastries, pizzas, and more. They also have fast heat-up times, so you can start baking right away.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The gas deck ovens are energy efficient:&nbsp;Gas deck ovens are energy efficient, helping you save money on your energy bills while also reducing your carbon footprint. They also have the ability to recover heat quickly, reducing the time between batches and increasing productivity.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The gas configurations are easily customizable:&nbsp;Gas deck ovens come in a variety of sizes and configurations, allowing you to choose the right one for your kitchen\u2019s needs. They can also be customized to fit your specific baking needs, the gas distribution to the oven is easily adjustable to ensure a certain limitation of gas going through to the oven at any given time.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-features-of-a-gas-deck-oven\">Features of a Gas Deck Oven:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Multiple Decks:&nbsp;Gas deck ovens can have one to four decks, each with its own cooking chamber. This allows for multiple products to be baked at the same time, increasing productivity and efficiency.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Removable Trays:&nbsp;Gas deck ovens often come with removable trays, making cleaning a breeze. The trays catch any spills or crumbs, preventing them from clogging the burners and causing damage.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Insulated Cooking Chambers:&nbsp;The cooking chambers in gas deck ovens are often insulated, providing consistent heat and reducing heat loss. This helps to save energy and maintain a consistent baking temperature.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Control Panels:&nbsp;Gas deck ovens come with control panels that allow you to easily control the temperature and humidity of the cooking chamber. This allows you to fine-tune the baking process for different products and ensure that they are baked to perfection every time.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-choosing-the-right-gas-deck-oven\">Choosing the right Gas Deck Oven:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Size:&nbsp;Consider the size of your bakery and the amount of space you have available for the oven. Gas deck ovens come in a variety of sizes, from small countertop models like the single deck 2 tray gas oven to large floor-standing units such as the 2 deck 4 tray gas oven.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Capacity:&nbsp;Think about the amount of baked goods you will be producing each day and choose an oven that can accommodate your needs. Consider the number of decks you will need and the size of the cooking chambers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Budget:&nbsp;Finally, consider your budget when choosing a gas deck oven. Prices can vary widely, so it is important to choose an oven that meets your needs and fits within your budget.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\">Conclusion:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gas deck ovens are an essential tool for any commercial or small-scale bakery that specializes in baked goods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"LOWEST POWER CONSUMPTION OVEN IN KENYA! 1 deck 2 tray gas deck oven\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ysLRtlLIWj4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Gas Deck Ovens in Kenya: The Key to low power consumption baking.
