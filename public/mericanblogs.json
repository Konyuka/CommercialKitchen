Before committing to a specific range, it’s best to know how your commercial kitchen is outfitted and what adjustments will be necessary. For commercial electric ranges, know your voltage (208V, 240V, etc.) and phase hookup, single or three. If you’re opting for a gas range, it is important to know your gas plug ahead of time.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12418\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/kitchen-equipments-8.jpg\" alt=\"Commercial kitchen equipment Merican Limited\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">kitchen equipment by Merican Limited</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Electric ranges are simpler to operate and generally considered safer, ideal for school cafeterias who won’t be constantly operating their range. Additional benefits of electric cooking equipment include: considered cheaper and easier to install, no danger of a gas leak and more efficient because energy input is converted directly to heat.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Gas units are still the most popular in commercial kitchens and for good reason. Some benefits of gas heating include: greater control over heat intensity, reduced wait time as the heating element heats up, quicker cool down, not inconvenienced by power fluctuations and to heat faster for quicker turnaround.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Range Sizing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The larger the width, in theory, the more product you’ll be able to produce. You’ll want to consider how much product you’ll be cooking up during high volume rushes, and factor that into the size. You’ll also want to keep hood space top of mind. Many health codes require hoods to extend at least 6” beyond the piece of equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> If space is becoming an issue, there are other options besides open burners. Griddle tops are popular among restaurants and diners specializing in breakfast foods. If you’re working with a menu with more variety, you’ll want to take into consideration the number of burners vs. griddle space to configure your unit.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12589\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/IMG_9279-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Commercial Kitchen by Merican\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Commercial Kitchen by Merican</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Different Range Top Configuration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Open Burner/Grate Tops</strong>: The most popular of the range top configurations, these feature cast iron or steel framing supporting the pot or pan above the burner. They allow for more flexibility, accommodating several different types of cooking methods. They usually come with a removable tray under the grates to catch any spills for easy cleaning.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hot Tops</strong>: These steel plates typically range between 12 and 18 inches wide and ½ to 1 inch thick. The heat input is generally greater for hot tops than for a single open burner.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Graduated Hot Tops</strong>: These feature two or three concentric rings that may be specified to accommodate different size stockpots. The burners are designed and positioned to heat the different rings, beginning with the center and moving out to match the base diameter of the stockpot. If a smaller pot is being used, only the inner rings are heated.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Griddle Tops</strong>: These steel plates fitted over the range are great for cooking a wide variety of foods like pancakes, breads and buns, bacon, hamburgers, chicken, etc. They transfer heat from the plate directly into the food. The thickness of the plate is important as it directly affects the cooking process, determining how quickly the desired temperature is reached. Medium-duty griddle tops are between ½ to ¾ inch thick, whereas heavy-duty tops are typically around 7/8 to 1-1/2 inch thick. The thicker the plate, the longer the heat retention, more even the heat distribution, and the less likely to warp.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>French Hot Plates</strong>: Most common on commercial electric ranges, these round metal plates are traditionally 6 to 10 inches in diameter and designed to fit over the top of a burner. They are used in lieu of an open burner to provide a more even heat distribution and easier cleanup.</p>\r\n",

In some cases, a business owner may choose to expand their restaurant in size, while others may choose to diversify their service offering. All these options may necessitate a change in the commercial kitchen set up to adapt to the growing needs of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When remodeling your commercial kitchen you should consider the involvement of experts in the field, change of equipment, and consultation from your staff. All of these aspects ensure you create a space that not only contributes to overall efficiency but also promotes the quality delivery of your clients’ food.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12787\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/MG_8420-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Commercial kitchen by Merican Limited</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Expert Consultation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Consulting experts in the commercial kitchen business is a core element in seeing the success of your project. Not only do experts assess the amount of space the business has, but they also adapt the space to ensure efficiency through having custom fabrications. Furthermore, consultants may also advise on possible improvements in commercial equipment including;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>coffee machines</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>commercial chillers and</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>cooking equipment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Acquiring such advice would be essential in promoting quality in the kitchen through having energy-efficient equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This service addresses diverse needs including changes in business location at a reasonable price. Thus, we eliminate the hustle of figuring things out ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Commercial Equipment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to consider introducing some new commercial equipment to promote the efficiency of your kitchen. Changes in equipment can inform the quality of food provided. Aside from this, changes in technology should be a reason to update your equipment to newer versions. However, when considering new equipment, it is vital to consult experts to ensure you get energy-efficient equipment that is valuable for the organization. In addition, a business owner should consider the opinion of their staff.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Staff members are more aware of which commercial kitchen equipment requires improvement based on their experience in the kitchen. Hence, consulting the team results in the creation of a fully equipped commercial kitchen that contributes to good service delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While some of the equipment may require complete change, it is important to also clean older equipment. Hood ranges, for instance, only require a clean to ensure they can be used again. Understanding all aspects which require improvement is also faster when the consultant is engaged in the equipment assessment process. Doing so also contributes to increased confidence among the staff on the length of use of some commercial kitchen equipment. Hence, having a meeting to assess the needs of the business would be a good starting point before the remodeling occurs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Remodeling your commercial kitchen may appear a daunting task when you consider it. However, when broken into steps with a consultant, it is easier to attain your end objective. Furthermore, having your kitchen remodeled may significantly contribute to the speed at which you aim to attain your business expansion goals. In the process remember to consult your key staff members as well experts to ensure you attain an environment that works well for your team. In the end, your commercial kitchen staff’s success is all the success you need. </p>\r\n",

      "rendered": "\r\n<p>Restaurant kitchens must have a commercial fryer as most food options include deep frying ingredients. Aside from this, some type food is often fried during the preparation process. Therefore, they are a very common option in many commercial kitchens.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-12780\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Commercial-deep-fryer.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\r\n<figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Commercial electric deep fryer</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Different commercial fryers exist and this include deep fat fryers, air fryers and pressure fryers. Their usage depends on the ingredients and healthy standards of the menu as designed by the chef. If you are a restaurant or cafe that prides itself on healthy eating then air fryer would be your best option. A quick service restaurant like KFC would go for pressure fryers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The different fuel types used for the different fryers inform the results of the cooking experience. Electric commercial fryers are known for their energy efficiency and are convenient to work around because the temperature rises faster and is suitable for restaurants where customers are in a rush. The commercial electric fryer is easy to install and use for new restaurants. It comes with manuals that enable people to understand its functionality and use the equipment immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An electric deep fryer is a good option if you’re trying to get the maximum ideal temperature for cooking. However, this is not an ideal solution when you aim to save on energy because it tends to consume a lot of power.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the gas commercial deep fryer has heating elements on both frying pan sides. It has more capacity and is preferred in restaurants with a high volume of customers. However, this is commonly not used in restaurants requiring quick turnaround times for the clients. It provides gentler heat to the oil; therefore, food is fried properly. They are installed in specific zones in the kitchen due to the link to the gas pipeline.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When purchasing either one of this, consider the following</strong>;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n<li>Capacity. Based on the size of your commercial kitchen, you should check the sizes available when you are making a purchase. In small restaurants or cafes, having a 8–12 liter capacity is sufficient. On the other hand, 15–24 liter options are ideal in high-volume restaurants. One should also consider having a double fryer when the menu includes frying meats and veggies separately.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Durability. The product&#8217;s life is vital when purchasing commercial kitchen equipment; for commercial fryers, consider the product&#8217;s body material, quality, fuel type, and usage. Stainless steel bodies have longer lives and bear wear and tear better than other options.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Advanced technology. Future-ready equipment ensures it provides service for long periods as technological changes occur. Highly efficient options with digital controls enable you to attain good results each time you use the product. It is also ideal to consider filtration options and boil-out temperatures.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li> </li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Ease of maintenance. It is essential to check the ease of maintaining the equipment. The equipment is prone to grease build up and material burnt stains due to the high temperatures. Therefore, it is essential to clean it every 2-3 days if your staff cannot handle a daily routine which is preferable.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, if you are looking to buy an fryer soon, it is essential to consider the above when purchasing the equipment. You can explore Merican&#8217;s options to select the most suitable option for your business or restaurant kitchen. With years of experience in the field, you are guaranteed a quality and customized experience from us.</p>\r\n",

These could include iced coffees or milkshakes, or juices. Having powerful blenders to provide these options to clients is ideal. The blenders could also be used in food preparation.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Dishwashers. </strong>The dishwashers provide sterile cleaning conditions for dishes.

One should always consider the emergency exit protocol to create the floor design to promote staff and visitors&#8217; safety. Furthermore, the commercial kitchen should have equipment and floor to prevent accidents. Due to the high use of fluids in coffee shops, spills are likely to occur when creating foods.

      "rendered": "\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past week, Merican Limited celebrated 8. Years of service in the field. We have been graced to have supportive team members and unique clients in our journey. Aside from this, we have noted a shift in commercial kitchens as technological changes continue to be integrated in the field. Such changes have seen us create products that align with current needs, promote production efficiency, and save on energy. We are also sure that as we continue to grow, we will introduce more technologically advanced products, as technology and innovation is vital in the growth of commercial kitchen services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Increased Menu Options</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenya is considered an international destination due to its tourism openness. In the kitchen sector, we have seen an increase in commercial kitchens providing diverse cuisines. Although our culture already incorporated this diversity in its tribal factions, the rise in international cuisine has necessitated a wide range of restaurant commercial equipment. Furthermore, this shift has also increased how fast our clients grow, as people are more inclined to incorporate more than commercial kitchen ranges in their kitchens. In recent years, commercial kitchen basics include chillers and fridges, griddles, ovens, microwaves, and shelving equipment. Restaurants dealing in unique cuisine have additional equipment suited for their business needs, with some having more griddle table space compared to ranges for Asian cuisine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Technological Change</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most notable changes is using convection ovens in cooking. In addition, there has been an increase in the use of combination functions, where microwaves function as ovens. Merican has welcomed these shifts as they offer more energy-efficient production for our clients and contribute to sustainability efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1000_F_269267903_mELjyCLPN3am3DJZBTrtUYX7pUTiFhDs-transformed-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12676\"/><figcaption>Convection oven</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Design and Layout Changes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using technology in designing spaces for our clients has addressed efficiency needs and space optimization requirements. While before, clients would often go blind into the kitchen layout process, we have inculcated this into our initial consult with individuals looking to venture into the field. Commercial kitchen layout and design is vital in attaining performance goals and advancing how safe a kitchen is in the meeting is targets. Furthermore, kitchen design varies based on client requirements. Layouts created for commercial hospital kitchens vary from those created for a restaurant. Similarly, the equipment used in different spaces is different. Having incorporated this aspect ensures that new equipment designs work well in the space, with under-bench installation being considered. In addition, we also look into selecting multi-functional commercial kitchen equipment while being slim for the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/62-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12683\"/><figcaption>Commercial Kitchen Designs </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Safety and Health Improvements</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government requires that restaurants and other commercial kitchens create food in a clean and safe environment. This ensures there is reduced risks and hazards, more so in kitchens where there is high hazard risk. Our equipment goes through testing to align to safety and performance standards in the field. Therefore, you can always rely on Merican for all your commercial kitchen needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our diverse experience over the years, you can always trust that our equipment and service is aimed and promoting your success.

How prepared a kitchen is for fire risks is vital. However, it is more important to prevent fires from starting as they are associated with devastating losses to the business.</p>\n<p>Aside from meeting minimum safety requirements in the country and industry, you must also provide staff training and promote preventative maintenance for equipment.</p>\n<p><strong>What are the Hazards?</strong></p>\n<p>A commercial kitchen has hazards everywhere due to fuel and fire in food preparation. It is vital for one to ensure appliances are regularly checked. Some of these include deep fryers, commercial kitchen grills, ranges, and stoves to manage heating elements and reduce fire risk. Aside from this, hazards may arise from commonly ignored places, such as shelving and how the stock is stored in the kitchen. As a result, it would be ideal to consider how flammable products are stored to ensure fires do not arise or spread across the facility.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12732\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WhatsApp-Image-2022-10-20-at-7.56.45-PM-1-1024x678.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" />Employee fire safety training also ensures staff is aware of the various flammable items in the commercial kitchen. These items should be labeled with commonly used fire hazard symbols. Furthermore, all personnel must know how to operate a fire extinguisher and the different appliances. Doing so will ensure the risk of fire does not arise in food preparation.</p>\n<p><strong><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12750\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/our-team.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" />When a Fire Arises</strong></p>\n<p>Incorporating an emergency exit plan in your commercial kitchen is crucial as you start your kitchen. Doing so ensures all staff can be safely evacuated when a fire occurs. One should consider the number of exits in the restaurant and kitchen as well as whether the staff is familiar with these locations and their accessibility. Any blocks existing to bar entry should be managed to ensure people can leave the venue effectively.</p>\n<p>Commercial kitchen owners should also attempt fire drills for their staff to address evacuation of guests, exiting the building, using the fire extinguisher, notifying fire department, and accounting for all staff and guests at the assembly point. This plan should be implemented often annually.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimizing Risks with Good Design </strong></p>\n<p>Designing the commercial kitchen should be considered the first step in mitigating fire. Incorporating experts in floor design and acquiring equipment facilitates ease in adopting requirements by the local bodies and adopting effective exit routines. While one may struggle to create an ideal floor plan alone, our experts at Merican review the space available and create a design that incorporates efficiency and safety in the kitchen.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12658\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_3807-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" />With over 8 years in commercial kitchen design and equipment supply in Kenya and East Africa, you can rely on our expertise in the field to ensure your commercial kitchen layout and design meets your efficiency, fire, and safety needs.

One of the common points we use to improve sustainable production is creating products that are energy efficient. With rising costs of production, it is vital that your commercial kitchen equipment is energy efficient. To promote energy efficiency, we provide commercial dishwashers, ovens, cooking ranges, and commercial fridges. These are created with the customer in mind promoting efficiency in your commercial kitchen while saving energy in creating your client’s products.</p>\n<p><strong><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12733\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WhatsApp-Image-2022-10-20-at-7.55.48-PM-1024x678.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" />Consultation</strong></p>\n<p>We also promote sustainable commercial kitchens by engaging our clients in the project implementation process. We conduct planning and help our clients in setting up their kitchens. In this phase, we focus on promoting efficiency in delivering food and out of the kitchen. Our team of experts works with our clients to ensure chefs and other kitchen staff can operate effectively in the kitchen. Furthermore, we also provide alternative solutions based on the client&#8217;s energy efficiency needs. Therefore, the consultation space ensures the commercial kitchen staff can efficiently operate while working.</p>\n<p><strong>Repair of Equipment</strong></p>\n<p>Faulty equipment costs companies in lost energy and poor-quality products. This is the same case in commercial kitchens. It is vital for individuals to consider working on commercial kitchen improvements. Conducting cleaning for commercial hoods, cookers, and ovens is one method to promote energy efficiency while reducing kitchen accidents. While equipment may require checks at different times, having a minimum of a bi-annual check on your commercial kitchen equipment ensures all equipment is functioning appropriately. Repair solutions at Merican focus on restoring the product to its initial performance. Therefore, our team ensures your commercial kitchen can always perform optimally. <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12735\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WhatsApp-Image-2022-10-20-at-7.55.43-PM-1024x678.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"763\" height=\"505\" /></p>\n<p>Sustainability in commercial kitchens and competitiveness come from using suitable equipment. Good commercial kitchen equipment will ensure your commercial kitchen provides quality food for its clients. Our proven success in the field displays the importance of considering sustainable solutions in your kitchen. One way to get there is to train our team on improving energy efficiency and having high-quality products. Contact us today for your commercial kitchen equipment and restoration needs.</p>\n",

These businesses can be started in any size, servicing smaller communities or larger groups. To promote the business&#8217;s success, it is essential to have all the right equipment to ensure you produce quality food for your clients. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the essentials tools for a fast-food commercial kitchen:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Refrigeration Equipment</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fresh food is essential in promoting good taste. Having refrigerators and freezers in the commercial kitchen should enable you to keep all food fresh for an extended period. Commercial refrigerator-freezer combinations are a good option for kitchens due to their flexibility. Furthermore, these options have different styles. As a result, one can choose one based on the size of their commercial kitchen. Aside from this, one could choose between having drawers or cabinets for the cooling units.  You could choose from under-counter chillers, display chillers, 2-door chillers, bottle coolers, and kitchen fridges. Having the different options ensures you can keep your food fresh and store drinks for clients in a convenient way for your staff to reach. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Fryers</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast-food restaurants are renowned for their fried food. Therefore, having a commercial fryer is a must in the commercial kitchen. While offerings may vary between French fries, onion rings, sausages, and other fried food, all of these require similar deep-frying equipment. Some options you could choose from include having a double-deep fryer, chips dump, chips scuttle, and a salamander grill. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Hood</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting grease, oil, and smoke out is required to promote kitchen safety, especially in a fast-food joint. <img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-12722 alignright\" src=\"https://mericanltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Untitled-1080-×-1080-px-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"239\" height=\"239\" /></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, having a hood installed will ensure you have a safe kitchen. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since these are often customized to fit a kitchen space, having your commercial kitchen consultant’s advice will lead to the best results. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Prep Table</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prep tables are ideal in restaurants that cook pizzas, sandwiches, and salads. They provide a space for staff to dice meat and prepare food ingredients. Furthermore, these are often combined with refrigeration units below the table or storage units. Therefore, one can choose to have them customized to fit their restaurant offerings. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sinks</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sinks are not only essential for the kitchen but are required by law in commercial kitchens. In a fast-food establishment, the sinks can serve a variety of uses, including rinsing products or cleaning hands. In many cases, fabricated sinks are made as they adapt to the needs of a commercial kitchen.  </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Shelving</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Storage shelves provide you with the space to keep products that have a longer shelf life. A stainless-steel wall shelf is ideal for permanent space for some items. On the other hand, you could also choose to have mobile shelving units or use 4-tier racks for some mobile storage. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Griddle</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial griddles can vary based on the countertop space available for a commercial kitchen. These are essential if your commercial kitchen serves eggs, fish, burgers, steak, or pancakes. Many restaurants have permanent griddles with spare countertop space, while others have drop-in griddles for less frequent use. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Serving Equipment</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One should not forget the food serving aspects. For fries, it is common to have a hot showcase. Some restaurants may also install a buffet counter when offering a variety of meat options for their clients. This is customizable based on the size of the commercial kitchen and is ideal when creating food in large batches. Therefore, remember to make a choice based on what is ideal for your kitchen.  </span></p>\n",
